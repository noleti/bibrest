* bibrest
- Simple RESTful API to expose bibtex library
- Based on Python, using =flask= and =pybtex=
- Intended to be used as backend for websites rendering bibtex reference lists 

- Nils Ole Tippenhauer, SUTD, 2016

** Installation
Install flask and pubtex

#+begin_src bash
sudo pip install flask pybtex
#+end_src

Then, the development flask server can be started with

#+begin_src bash
python bibrest.py
#+end_src

It will serve the test.bib in the same folder. 

** Resources
*** =/bibs=
Will return all bibtex entries, including the project field

*** =/bib/<key>=
Will return bibtex for article =<key>=

*** =/projects=
Will return human readable list of all project keys in the database

*** =/projects/<projectkey>=
Will return bibtex of all entries with that =<projectkey>=

** Deployment
For more stable deployments, we recommend gunicorn, apache, or nginx.

** Todo/known bugs
- Only one project per entry
